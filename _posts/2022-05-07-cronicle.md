I really don't like cron jobs and crontab:
- crontab has a horrible syntax (it's [from 1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)...)
- logging the output of jobs needs to be specified manually
- viewing logs is inconvenient (even just for checking whether a job ran or not!)
- cron jobs run in a minimal environment that's inconvenient to modify

[Cronicle](https://github.com/jhuckaby/Cronicle) is a friendlier alternative ("a task scheduler with a web based front-end UI").

**Very important**: the default username/password for the web interface is `admin`/`admin`. This could let anyone run arbitrary shell commands on your server! Change the password immediately after setting up.

Here's how to run Cronicle Dockerized.

```shell
docker run -d \
  -v /cronicle-data/data:/opt/cronicle/data:rw \
  -v /cronicle-data/logs:/opt/cronicle/logs:rw \
  -v /cronicle-data/plugins:/opt/cronicle/plugins:rw \
  -v /cronicle-data/app:/app:rw \
  --hostname your_hostname.com -p 11531:3012 \
  -e CRONICLE_base_app_url='http://your_hostname.com:11531' \
  --name cronicle \
  bluet/cronicle-docker:latest
```

You can now point `http://your_hostname.com` to the correct IP address and visit `http://your_hostname.com:11531` in your browser to access a web interface for Cronicle.

Comments:
* 11531 is a port number chosen randomly. You should generally use 80, the default port used by web browsers; for me that port is occupied by other applications I run on the host web server.
* The source for the Docker image `bluet/cronicle-docker` is [here](https://github.com/bluet/docker-cronicle-docker). 
* On 7 May 2022, I confirmed that these steps work on brand new server, with revision [`3e4211e`](https://github.com/bluet/docker-cronicle-docker/tree/3e4211e8902bcd17c6192f6ed1f2a8f3cf0e24ba) of `bluet/cronicle-docker`.
